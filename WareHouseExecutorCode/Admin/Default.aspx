                                                            A warehouse management system, or a WMS, is a key part of the supply chain and primarily

                                                            The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information

                                                            Warehouse management systems often utilize Auto ID Data Capture technology, such
                                                            as barcode scanners, mobile computers, wireless LANs and potentially RFID to efficiently
                                                            monitor the flow of products. Once data has been collected, there is either a batch

                                                            The database can then provide useful reports about the status of goods in the warehouse.
                                                            Warehouse management systems are stand alone systems, or a module in an ERP system.
                                                            The objective of a warehouse management system is to provide an application to automatically
                                                            receive inventory, process orders, and handle returns. Use of this technology optimizes
                                                            the transaction processes and correspondingly improves the efficiency of the associate
                                                            labor and inventory within the system.</font></p>
